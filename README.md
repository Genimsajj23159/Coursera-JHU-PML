## Executive Summary
This study aims to classify human exercise performance using accelerometer data collected from different body parts. The dataset consists of motion sensor readings from the belt, forearm, arm, and dumbbell of six individuals performing weightlifting exercises in five different ways. The goal is to develop a machine learning model that can accurately predict the execution manner.

Several classification models were trained and evaluated, including Random Forest, Gradient Boosting Machine (GBM), Support Vector Machine (SVM), and Neural Networks. The models were compared based on accuracy using a validation set, and the best-performing model was chosen for final predictions. Random Forest emerged as the most effective model, offering high accuracy and robustness. The final predictions were made on a separate test set, demonstrating the applicability of the model for human activity recognition.
